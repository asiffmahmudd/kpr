1. First I declared an object to read the file
2. Read the object
3. parsed the data
4. Then thought of an algorithm to check the data according to the requirements
5. Wrote the data into a csv file.

Challenge: The main challenge was thinking about the algorithm and making it efficient. Although the current one is not effiecient enough it can be improved. 

Limitations: 
	1. It may take excessive time if a large dataset is given. 
	2. The dataset has to be in the exact structure given to me.
	3. Letter casing of the names can be a problem in terms of determining the weights.
	
	
**************
You can download the files and run the index.html to see the outputs. A file will be downloaded upon uploading the dataset.
